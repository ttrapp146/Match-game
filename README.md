# Match-game

Old project from 2015 or earlier
Originally created as applet, but moved files around and changed code some to make it a runnable jar
Incomplete but can be used as demo
Art for blocks not by me.  They are snk characters

How to play::

space bar:  select block
arrow keys:  move

make matches of 3 or more.  after a match new blocks fall slowly.  try matching blocks before everything falls to get a long "combo"

try to match the blocks shown above in order within your next 3 matches (not enforced)
